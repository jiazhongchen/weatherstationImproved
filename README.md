# weatherstationImproved

Thanks for squix78's great work of OLED libraries, we are now ready to add more features based on his work.

So far I have done:

1. Add DHT22 temperature and humidity sensors so the 5th page are showing real time local temperature and humidity.
2. Post the real time temperature and humidity to my thingspeak channel.

please be aware that you might also need to add esp8266-oled-ssd1306 libraries into your arduino libraries before this project can compile!!!
