Thanks for squix78's great work of OLED libraries, we are now ready to add more features based on his work.

So far I have done:

1. Add DHT22 temperature and humidity sensors so the 5th page are showing real time local temperature and humidity.
2. Post the real time temperature and humidity to my thingspeak channel.
